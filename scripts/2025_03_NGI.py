### functions

# Functions may be used to carry out a block of code whenever called. A function
# is defined by using the def keyword followed by the function name with the input
# argument(s) assigned inside the parenthesis. The value returned from the function
# is defined using the return keyword


# It is useful to assign data types to the inputs, which is done by separating
# the input argument name and it's corresponding data type by colon in the 
# function definition. The data type of the return value is given after the ->
# symbol.


# We can set default values to inputs by specifying them after the equals sign
# in the function definition.


# Setting default values means that we do not need to pass all the inputs to 
# the function.


# Exercise 10
