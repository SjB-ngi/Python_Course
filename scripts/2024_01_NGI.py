### introduction and overview over Spyder


### basic datatypes: strings, integers, floats, print function

# there are 2 ways to create strings:


# ... and both can be used to create multi line strings with linebreaks


# integers = numbers without decimals


# floats = floating point numbers = numbers with decimals


# the print() function is used to print output and results to the console


# there are functions to convert datatypes into each other


# Exercise 1

### operators: +, -, /, *, **, //, %


# Exercise 2

### variables, string formatting

# variables are placeholders for all kinds of datatypes
# variable names should be explicit and informative


# multiple variables can be defined in one line


# string formatting is used to create dynamic strings and there are multiple
# options
# string formatting option 1


# string formatting option 2


# string formatting option 3


# typical use case for string formatting: file path creation
# here we use a "fromatted raw" string so that the backslashes are ignored


### datatypes: lists, tuples, dictionaries, indices, exceptions / errors

# lists are mutable / editable collections of all kinds of objects
# lists and tuples are ordered and elements have an index, starting with 0
# index          0         1           2

# to call specific elements of a list or tuple, use the index behind the list


# lists can be modified e.g. by adding or inserting values


# len() gives us the number of elements of a list, tuple or string


# range() by default creates a range of numbers starting from 0 up to the
# entered number at a step of 1


# lists can be multiplied


# lists can be sliced up with indices


# a dictionary is an unordered collection of pairs of keys and values
# keys must be unique, values can be anything
#              keys          values


# new entries can be added to the dictionary like this


# Exercise 3
