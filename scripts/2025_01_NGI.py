### introduction and overview over Spyder


### basic datatypes: strings, integers, floats, print function

# Datatypes

# integer numbers are represented with an "int" data type


# decimal numbers are represented with a "float" data type


# text is represented with a "str" data type
# "str" is short for string, or string of characters
# you may use either double quotes, ", single quotes, ', or
# tripled double or single quotes, """ / ''', to construct
# a string


# You can print the data to the console by using the print() function


# You may check the datatype by using the type() function, if you want
# to see the results, you have to print it out





# you can change the data type by using the int(), float() and str()
# functions. Data might get lost in the process



# Exercise 1


# Exercise 2

### variables, string formatting


# Variables can be assigned data by setting them equal to a value
# python automatically assigns a data type to the variable


# You may also assign multiple variables respectively using comma


# variable names should be explicit and informative



# There are multiple ways to format a string

# string concatenation: "string" + "another string"


# .format() function replaces the {} with the function inputs


# The string may be stored as a variable. We can add multiple inputs
#  to .format()

# f-strings are assigned by adding the character f before the string
# These are useful for having a good idea about what you're printing


# formatting strings is useful when working with or saving multiple images.
# Here we can use some info to give file names to our images.


### datatypes: lists, tuples, dictionaries, indices, exceptions / errors

# The list is defined using square brackets


# You may index a list by using integers starting at 0


# You may add data to the list


# You can find the amount of entries of a list using len()


# You can slice a list by using colons, it returns a list
# from (and including) the index 0 to, but not including
# index 2


# Tuples act similarly to lists in many ways, but cannot change
# after assignment



# Dictionaries store data in an unstructured way
# These are indexed using keys (strings)

# Dictionaries are defined by using curly brackets
# Key and value pairs are separated by colon, entries
# are separated with a comma. The values can be any data type




# The values of a dictionary do not need to be lists
# they can be any data type, like strings



# range() by default creates a range of numbers starting from 0 up to the
# entered number at a step of 1


# you can set the starting number and the step size similarly
# to how we slice lists (start, stop, step)


# Exercise 3

# Exercise 4
