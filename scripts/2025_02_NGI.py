# repetition


### control structures: conditional statements: if, elif, else, match cases,
### operators

# control structures help to either avoid or repeat certain parts of code
# conditional statements make use of operators to compare if certain conditions
# are True or False



# these operators can be used in logical statements


# elif can be used for additional tests NB! only if the first if statement
# is false

# match-cases are a new alternative to check if a variables matches something (==)


### control structures: loops: while loop, for loop
# loops are used to repeat parts of code

# while loop is a loop that runs until a condition is not True anymore



# Exercise 5



# a while loop can be used to iterate over a list




# # a better solution is however to use a for loop which is always finite


# for i in range(len(...)): is a typical construction to get an index


# Instead of iterating through indices, we may also iterate through
# the list elements


# The enumerate() function can be used to get both an element and the index


# a "list comprehension" is a 1 line for loop as an alternative to a normal
# for loop


# it is short but comes at the price of readability

### Boolean operators: or, and, not
# These are used to do operations on True/False data, i.e boolean data



# Exercise 6



# Exercise 7
